	<description>Why are my gruff colonists getting high on smokeleaf? Now your colonists can finally grow and harvest tobacco plants. Just like with smokeleaf joints, cigarettes can be crafted at any crafting spot.
    *Updated with mass production. Now you can produce entire packs of cigarettes at once.
	*Updated with cigars! Also find your own chocolate cigars.
